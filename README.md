## Introduction ##

Many people like to see at themselves often in a mirror. Many people spend most of their waking hours in front of computer. Many people who spend most of their waking hours in front of computer also want to see at themselves often in a mirror. If you are such a person, bookmark the [demo](http://myprojectguide.org/p/flash-mirror/index.html) link in your browser and visit often :)

Few months ago I was teaching a friend of mine how to program in ActionScript 3.0. This was the example software we developed. I decided to put this available to others who want to work on Camera and Video in ActionScript.

## Demo ##

Click on [http://myprojectguide.org/p/flash-mirror/index.html](http://myprojectguide.org/p/flash-mirror/index.html) to see the demo. You may need to install [Flash Player 10](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/) or higher. You will need to click on "Allow" button when it prompts you for camera access. Once it gets your camera it displays the local video. You can click on the full screen button to go to full screen view. You can click on the snapshot button to download the photo snapshot as a JPEG image file. This features requires Flash Player 10 or higher.

## Source Code ##

This is simple Flash Video application that demonstrates how to display your camera in mirror mode, take snapshot photos from your camera and do full-screen. The application requires Flash Player 10.0.22 or higher.

The main source file is [mirror.mxml](https://github.com/theintencity/flash-mirror/blob/master/src/mirror.mxml). There are changes in the [index.template.html](https://github.com/theintencity/flash-mirror/blob/master/html-template/index.template.html) file as well for allowFullScreen parameter.
